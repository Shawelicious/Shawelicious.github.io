        <header>Client-Side vs. Server-Side Development</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Client-side and server-side development are two distinct aspects of web development that involve different technologies, responsibilities, and functionalities. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Client-Side Development: 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Definition: Client-side development refers to the activities that take place on the user's device (typically a web browser) and involve the user interface and user experience.</li>
            <li>Technologies: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js.</li>
            <li>Responsibilities:
              <ol>Creating the structure (HTML) and style (CSS) of a web page.</ol>
              <ol>Implementing interactive and dynamic features using JavaScript.</ol>
              <ol>Managing the presentation layer and user interactions.</ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Advantages:
              <ol>Fast and responsive user interfaces.</ol>
              <ol>Reduces server load as certain operations are performed on the client's side.</ol>
              <ol>Enhanced user experience with dynamic and interactive elements.</ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Server-Side Development:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Definition: Server-side development involves activities that occur on the web server, managing and processing data, handling requests, and performing various server-related operations.</li>
            <li>Technologies: Server-side languages such as PHP, Python (Django), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring), and JavaScript (Node.js).</li>
            <li>Responsibilities:
              <ol>
              Handling data storage and retrieval from databases.</ol>
              <ol>Executing business logic and application functionality.</ol>
              <ol>Managing user authentication and authorization.</ol>
              <ol>Generating dynamic content to be sent to the client.</ol>
            </li>
            <li>Advantages:</li>
            <ol>Enhanced security as sensitive operations are performed on the server.</ol>
            <ol>Centralized control over data and business logic.</ol>
            <ol>Better scalability for handling a large number of users.</ol>
          </ul>
          <p>Interaction Between Client-Side and Server-Side:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Communication: Both sides communicate through protocols like HTTP(S), and they exchange data using formats like JSON or XML.</li>
            <li>Workflow: A typical web application involves the client making requests to the server, and the server responds with the necessary data or performs actions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Full-Stack Development:</p>
          <li>Definition: Developers who work on both client-side and server-side aspects are known as full-stack developers.</li>
          <li>Responsibilities: Full-stack developers have a broader skill set and can handle tasks ranging from designing user interfaces to managing server infrastructure.</li>
          <p>In modern web development, a balanced combination of both client-side and server-side technologies is crucial for building robust and efficient web applications. The choice between them depends on factors such as project requirements, performance considerations, and the desired user experience.</p>

        <p>1. Definition of the Internet</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Internet Basics:</li>
          <ol>Global network of interconnected computers.</ol>
          <ol>Enables communication, information sharing, and collaboration.</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Evolution of the World Wide Web</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Historical Development:</li>
          <ol>Birth of the World Wide Web (WWW) by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.</ol>
          <ol>The birth of the Internet can be traced back to the late 1960s and early 1970s with the development of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a pioneering network that laid the groundwork for the interconnected global network we know today. Here are key milestones in the birth and early development of the Internet:</ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>ARPANET Creation (1969):</li>
          <ol>ARPANET, the first packet-switching network, was developed by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA).</ol>
          <ol>On October 29, 1969, ARPANET's first message was sent between two computers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). The message was "LOGIN.</ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Development of TCP/IP (1970s):
            <ol>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) were developed by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn.</ol>
            <ol>TCP/IP became the standardized communications protocol suite for ARPANET, forming the foundation for the entire Internet.</ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Expansion and Standardization (1970s-1980s):</li>
          <ol>The ARPANET continued to grow, connecting more research institutions and universities.</ol>
          <ol>TCP/IP was adopted as the protocol for connecting diverse networks, leading to the term "Internet" (short for interconnected networks).</ol>
          <ol>The development of standardized protocols contributed to the Internet's expansion.</ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Domain Name System (DNS) Introduction (1983):</li>
          <ol>The Domain Name System, which translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, was introduced in 1983.</ol>
          <ol>This facilitated the use of easily memorable names instead of numerical IP addresses.</ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Commercialization (1990s):</li>
          <ol>The 1990s saw the commercialization of the Internet, with the launch of the World Wide Web and the development of browsers like Netscape.</ol>
          <ol>The Internet became accessible to the public, leading to a rapid increase in websites and online services.</ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Global Expansion and Popularization (1990s-Present):</li>
          <ol>The Internet expanded globally, connecting people, businesses, and governments worldwide.</ol>
          <ol>Technologies like broadband and mobile internet further increased accessibility.</ol>
          <ol>The Internet has become an integral part of everyday life, shaping communication, commerce, education, and entertainment.</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>The birth and development of the Internet were collaborative efforts involving numerous individuals, institutions, and technological advancements. The ARPANET project laid the groundwork for the interconnected and decentralized network that has since transformed how information is shared and accessed globally.</p>
        <ol>Transition from static to dynamic content.</ol>

        <p>3. Key Internet Protocols</p>

            <ol>Facilitates reliable data transmission between connected devices.</ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>4. Client-Server Architecture</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Roles:
            <ol>Clients request services or resources.</ol>
            <ol>Servers provide requested services or resources.</ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

        <header>Creating an Account on Github</header>
        <p>
         
      <h4> Create a personal account to get started with GitHub.</h4>
        <p>
          About your personal account on GitHub.com
        </p>
        <p>
          To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create a free personal account on GitHub.com and verify your email address.

          Every person who uses GitHub.com signs in to a personal account. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and has a username and profile. For example, see (https://github.com/octocat).
        </p>

        <p>Signing up for a new personal account</p>
        <p><ol>
          1. Go to https://github.com
        </ol></p>
        <ol>
          2. Click Sign up.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          3. Follow the prompts to create your personal account.
        </ol>
